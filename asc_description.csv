When incidents feel wrong—air sharp, lights glitching, hallways rerouting—he listens for the scorched-mineral edge of danger and moves first.",Being surprised in a room built to look safe.,Losing control of his body routine and showing fear on camera.,"Being erased, replaced, or rewritten while the city applauds.",Build an invisible do-not-touch perimeter around the people and assets he’s sworn to keep safe.,Prove what stalks high-profile rooms before it becomes a public contagion.,Step off the stage without leaving a trail—or a vacancy someone can wear.,"Clean exits, clean corridors, clean timing.","Control rituals that keep the mask steady—water, breath, and measured steps.",The rare moment alone when his voice can be normal again.,Cover Star,"Protagonist’s public-facing cover—uses celebrity gravity to redirect eyes, calm crowds, and make emergency moves look like ‘official plans.’",Spotlight,Severin knows how to shine without burning. He keeps the protagonist invisible when needed—and undeniable when it’s time to act.,"He’s dating a well-known model, and the relationship is equal parts real affection and relentless spotlight management. She understands the game, but she also pushes him to keep one corner of his life unperformed.",,,,,,
Transcendence,Protagonist,Bram W,8,5,"A composed, authoritative figure with a pilot’s bearing and disciplined posture, often seen in clean, wind-safe attire and aviator sunglasses during emergencies. He carries a signal flare launcher like a practical tool rather than a weapon, and his calm presence reads as crisis leadership more than politics.",Second-Chance mayor who leads from the crisis line and never treats survival as ceremony.,Fires a flare upward that bursts into a blinding beacon and forces aerial targets down.,Stability is what holds when things start breaking.,"Bram Willemsen is the sitting mayor, known more as a crisis-era leader than a ceremonial figure. Before office, he built his reputation in infrastructure planning and emergency operations, staying close to the work that keeps the city running when systems fail.","He prefers command centers and briefings over spotlight moments, listening longer than he speaks and acting decisively once a route is chosen. People around him describe a leader who trusts specialists, values preparation, and remain calm when the room turns loud.","When escape routes collapse and decisions narrow to seconds, Bram does not step back. He shows up where the city is weakest, not where it is safest, and that habit has made him both dependable and vulnerable.",Leaving outcomes unresolved,Becoming symbolic instead of useful,Systems choosing efficiency over people,Leave a city that no longer needs him,Make preparedness visible and repeatable,Keep the exit open for everyone,Clear skies after containment,Redundant systems and backup routes,Watching specialists take the lead,Civic Face,"Protagonist’s legitimacy bridge—puts his name on hard calls, coordinates responders, and turns ‘impossible’ into a signed directive.",Crisis Steward,"Bram leads from the wound: steady hands, blunt honesty. He gives the protagonist permission to do what must be done—and takes the heat.","They work as a housewife. His wife helps him unofficially with the political grind—calls answered, calendars smoothed, conversations prepped, fires put out before they become headlines. She’s not on the payroll, but she’s in the work, and Bram trusts her judgment more than any advisor’s.",,,,,,
Transcendence,Protagonist,Tate H,8,6,"Volunteer fire captain with a calm, grounded presence; short-cropped hair, weathered hands, steady eyes. In the Annex he wears long-sleeve flame-resistant workwear with chemical gloves and protective goggles perched or down when it matters; a battered clipboard with color-tabbed checklists never leaves his grip.","The Annex’s quiet caretaker—warm in the hallway, iron in an emergency. He keeps the lab livable while the core five chase deliverables upstairs, and he’s the one person left holding the door when the breach comes.","Launches upward with a two-handed fire axe, then brings it down in a decisive overhead cleave as he lands—an aerial strike built on commitment, momentum, and control.","If you can laugh, you can breathe, and if you can breathe, you can work.","The city started treating him like an unofficial problem-solver—whenever something goes wrong, Tate shows up, stabilizes the scene, and leaves no drama behind.","A board-backed Annex contract pulls him into Digital Dynamo’s hidden layer as a safety-and-continuity hand: inspections, drills, access paths, and the human-error gaps nobody budgets for.","He doesn’t chase credit. He keeps receipts, keeps people hydrated, keeps the corridors clear—then disappears back to the station before anyone thinks to thank him.","Freezing when the moment demands a decision—the call he didn’t make, repeated.","A preventable incident in the Annex: heat, fumes, sparks, or panic taking someone he was supposed to protect.",Becoming ‘the help’ forever—useful but unseen—until the day he’s the only one left to pay for everyone’s shortcuts.,"Make the Annex impossible to lose: clean routes, clear drills, zero confusion under pressure.","Earn a quiet kind of peace—proof that his hands can still build safety, not just survive disaster.",Finish one perfect model build and display it at the station as a tiny monument to patience and craft.,Firehouse duty and quiet hero work,"Spreadsheet tabs, checklists, and keeping spaces orderly",Model building and LARP weekends (the harmless kind of chaos),Quartermaster,"Protagonist’s quiet caretaker—keeps the Annex running, tracks supplies, patches gaps, and notices when the team’s morale is cracking.",Caretaker,"Tate doesn’t demand trust; he earns it with consistency. When everyone else is loud, he’s the calm room you can return to.","He lost his wife to a fire, and the grief didn’t turn into bitterness—it turned into duty. Becoming a deceased gave him a way to keep showing up for people on their worst night, the way he once wished someone could have shown up for him.",,,,,,
Transcendence,Protagonist,Benedict C,8,7,"Baseball cap, calm smile, wire-frame glasses, layered blues/greens (no yellow), work gloves tucked in back pocket, worn scroll satchel; hands always busy—hammer, plank, or a rolled parchment.","A civic chapel minister who earns trust the hard way—by showing up early, lifting first, and speaking last. In chaos he looks like just another worker… until the room starts moving because he did.","He springs upward and unfurls an aged scroll mid-air, voice low and steady. A radiant sigil forms above his head; he finishes the cadence, points, and the sigil breaks free—plunging fast to strike where the target stands.",You do not need permission to be helped.,Known as “Father Ben” in the community; close friends call him “Ben” and he avoids formal titles.,"Blends in by design: approachable streetwear, bright but grounded colors, always carrying tools for small repairs.","Moves like a doer, not a performer—people believe his words because they have watched him work.",Becoming a symbol instead of a person.,Helping the wrong way and leaving people worse off.,His body failing before the work is finished.,Leave Lewor’s community stronger than he found it.,Train volunteers who can outlast him and carry the work forward.,Build a quiet emergency response web—neighbors who respond before panic does.,Hands-on repairs and practical tools.,Shared meals with volunteers after long work.,Watching someone choose hope without needing applause.,Chaplain,"Protagonist’s trust-broker in the chapel lanes—speaks to the frightened, steadies volunteers, and keeps the mission human.",Moral Compass,Benedict never preaches at the protagonist—he reframes.

He carries her memory like a vow: compassion first, even when the world demands speed.",,,,,,
Transcendence,Protagonist,Thomas B,8,8,A tired professional calm held together by immaculate grooming and a habit of scanning exits. His posture is quiet but absolute—like a man who’s already decided what the truth costs.,"He speaks softly, writes one line in his notes, and suddenly the whole room realizes they’ve been caught by procedure—not volume.","Charlie keeps his patrol carbine low until the second it matters. A tight pivot, sling snaps taut, and the muzzle tilts skyward—three controlled bursts that cut the air like punctuation. He doesn’t spray; he corrects. Targets that thought height meant safety learn the city’s limits.",Write it down. Date it. Then we can talk,"Thomas finished a technical track at Lewor first—systems, reports, procedure—then pivoted into the academy and climbed through the precinct on reputation: clean cases, clean hands, no favors.","He visits the frat house alone because he knows the layout by muscle memory, but he keeps the truth close. He suspects the park crew has roots inside and treats every friendly hallway like a soft interview.","When Josh is taken, Brown’s team hits the corridor prepared—trained and equipped—only to learn the attackers don’t respond like normal suspects.
